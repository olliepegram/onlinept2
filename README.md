##Problem
  Online Personal Training (OPT) has become increasingly popular over the last couple of years, but to find an online personal    trainer you have to know their direct name, and even if you do know the trainers name and end up find their website, they     might not be the right PT for you. If the person does become a client of the trainer then they are likely to have all         communication through only email. As well as this most PT sites donâ€™t have any rating/review type systems in place which        could lead to the client not knowing what they are getting in to.
##Solution
  The solution to have to know the trainers direct name is that the site will have all the trainers in one place, so the user   can find a bunch of different trainers and find one that they like and end up with the correct PT for them. Communication     will be through the site and be a more organised communication (e.g.. uploading images directly). It will have a review and   rating system in place to know what other clients have said about the trainer.
